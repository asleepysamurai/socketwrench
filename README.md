Socket Wrench is a super simple, bare-bones, downloadable, cross platform, desktop GUI application (yes, it's Electron), which makes testing websockets easy. I wrote this to scratch a personal itch, and after having friends and colleagues find it useful, decided to clean it up a bit, make it more user friendly, and released for public use.
